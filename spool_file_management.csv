**Total daily spool:** ~13,000 files, ~38 GB/day, ~14 TB/year archived
**Compliance retention:** 4,130 files/day require 7-year retention (SOX, DOL)
**Replatform strategy:** Route to Cloud Storage lifecycle policies with Vault Lock for immutable compliance archives.

## Validation Summary

**Working assumptions stamped with confidence levels:**

| Assumption | Confidence | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Transaction volumes | HIGH | Scaled from 850 warehouses × 125M members × industry benchmarks |
| Session concurrency | MEDIUM | Extrapolated from warehouse count + shift patterns |
| CICS TPS | MEDIUM | Derived from POS transaction volume ÷ operating hours |
| Batch dependencies | HIGH | Standard retail operations sequence (close → post → report → allocate) |
| File I/O volumes | LOW | Placeholder math (records × avg size × frequency); needs disk I/O trace |
| Spool retention | HIGH | SOX/DOL 7-year statutory requirements well-documented |

**Flags requiring user correction:**
1. Actual CICS/WebSphere MQ topology (assumed CICS/400)
2. DB2/400 tablespace growth rate (assumed linear, likely seasonal spike)
3. Green-screen macro automation scripts (unknown prevalence)
4. Custom exit programs in QSYS libraries (black-box risk)

**Expert Validator signature block:**

[VALIDATOR_AI_PERSONA]
Cross-check: POS TPS × avg ticket size (~$130) × warehouses = $1.4B daily revenue
Expected: $250B annual ÷ 365 = $685M daily (off by 2x - likely includes wholesale B2B not in POS003)
ACTION REQUIRED: User must supply B2B/e-commerce transaction source (separate AS400 partition?)
STATUS: Conditional approval - proceed with caveat on revenue reconciliation gap
